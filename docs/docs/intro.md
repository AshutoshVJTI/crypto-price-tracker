# Crypto Price Tracker Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Crypto Price Tracker project. This documentation will guide you through the project setup, implementation details, and key decisions made during development.

## Project Overview

The Crypto Price Tracker is a web application built with Next.js that displays real-time cryptocurrency prices. It features a responsive design, live price updates, and search functionality. By default, the application displays the top 5 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, as specified in the requirements.

Key features include:
- Display of top 5 cryptocurrencies by market cap
- Automatic data refresh every 60 seconds
- Manual refresh button with loading indicator
- Search functionality to filter cryptocurrencies
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0 or later
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd crypto-tracker
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Technical Implementation

### API Integration

The application uses the CoinGecko API to fetch cryptocurrency data. The integration is implemented in `src/lib/api.ts` using Axios for HTTP requests. Key features include:

- Fetching top 5 cryptocurrencies by market cap
- Search functionality that expands the search to more cryptocurrencies
- Price and market cap data
- 24-hour price change percentage
- Optimized API calls to prevent rate limiting

### State Management

We chose React Query for state management because it provides:

- Built-in caching and automatic background updates
- Loading and error states
- Easy data refetching with automatic and manual refresh options
- Optimistic updates
- TypeScript support

The implementation can be found in:
- `src/providers/QueryProvider.tsx` - React Query setup
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Data fetching and state management

### Component Structure

The application is built with a component-based architecture:

- `CryptoCard.tsx` - Displays individual cryptocurrency information
- `page.tsx` - Main page component with search and refresh functionality
- `QueryProvider.tsx` - React Query configuration

### Styling

The project uses:
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Responsive design principles
- HeadlessUI for accessible components
- Heroicons for icons

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Real-time Updates

**Problem**: Needed to implement real-time price updates without overwhelming the API.

**Solution**: Used React Query's built-in polling and caching mechanisms to fetch new data at regular intervals while maintaining good performance.

### Challenge 2: Search Performance

**Problem**: Search functionality needed to be fast and efficient.

**Solution**: Implemented client-side filtering of cached data to provide instant search results without additional API calls.

### Challenge 3: Mobile Responsiveness

**Problem**: Needed to display dense information clearly on mobile devices.

**Solution**: Used Tailwind CSS's responsive classes and a grid system that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Best Practices

1. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Used TypeScript for type safety
   - Defined interfaces for API responses
   - Strict type checking enabled

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implemented data caching
   - Used client-side filtering
   - Optimized component re-renders

3. **Code Organization**
   - Separated concerns (API, components, providers)
   - Used consistent naming conventions
   - Maintained clear file structure

## Future Improvements

1. Add price alerts functionality
2. Implement price history charts
3. Add more detailed cryptocurrency information
4. Implement user preferences storage
5. Add more cryptocurrency pairs and exchange rates
